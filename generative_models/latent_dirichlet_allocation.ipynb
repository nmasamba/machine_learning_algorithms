      "\t the myostatin mstn gene is important because of its role in regulation of skeletal muscle growth in all vertebrates in this study crispr cas was utilized to successfully target the channel catfish ictalurus punctatus muscle suppressor gene mstn crispr cas induced high rates of mutagenesis in the target protein encoding sites of mstn mstn edited fry had more muscle cells p than controls and the mean body weight of gene edited fry increased by the nucleic acid alignment of the mutated sequences against the wild type sequence revealed multiple insertions and deletions these results demonstrate that crispr cas is a highly efficient tool for editing the channel catfish genome and opens ways for facilitating channel catfish genetic enhancement and functional genomics this approach may produce growth enhanced channel catfish and increase productivity introduction although fish comprise the most diverse group among the vertebrates a much smaller number of fish species is used for research and commercial purposes the major species cultured in the world include salmonids tilapias carps and catfishes there are about extant families and more than extant species of catfishes that have been identified and described living in marine and fresh waters this makes the siluriformes the second most diverse vertebrate order in fact one of every twenty vertebrate species is a catfish members of the family ictaluridae especially the genus ictalurus and their hybrids are the primary fish species used in aquaculture and sport fishing in the united states recently the production and the water surface area devoted to catfish culture in the united states declined due to several factors including increasing fuel and feed cost and competition from foreign imports genetic improvement of catfish offers a promising approach for this industry to maintain profitability and sustainability via development of high performance fish myostatin mstn or growth and differentiation factor is one of the well known examples of economically important genes mutations linked with the double muscled phenotype in belgian blue and piedmontese cattle were found in the mstn gene resulting in a significant increase in muscling compared to conventional cattle mstn was identified as a member of the transforming growth factor tgf superfamily that initiate their roles in regulation of skeletal muscle mass through the cell surface receptor activin receptors type ii acvr myostatin is a key regulator of skeletal muscle growth in all vertebrates and regulates myoblast differentiation in vitro altering myostatin through gene knockout or overexpression of inhibitors prominently increases muscle mass mutations of myostatin were also found in other cattle breeds and mammalian species whereas the mammalian myostatin is exclusively expressed from one gene copy and limited to skeletal muscle two or four copies have been found in fishes and differentially expressed in many tissues such as muscle eye stomach skin brain gonads kidney intestine liver spleen gill and heart in channel catfish ictalurus punctatus the mstn protein is actively expressed only from one copy on chromosome in different tissues the mstn protein is conserved in teleosts but its functions in fish remain to be revealed because of the lack of spontaneous mstn null mutation the knockout of mstn would further the study on the roles of this gene in fish species different molecular editing tools have been used to target mstn in teleosts such as zinc finger nucleases zfns and transcription activator like effector nucleases talens although the use of such engineered nucleases made the production of gene edited animals possible they are difficult to engineer and showed low specificity to target dna sequences recently a new gene editing system has been applied with higher targeting efficiency and lower cell toxicity known as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr crispr associated protein cas based on the type ii prokaryotic crispr from streptococcus pyogenes the co delivery of endonuclease cas combined with a synthetic small guide rna sgrna targeting certain gene s into eukaryotic cells can edit the genome by stimulating a double strand break dsb at a desired site s then the non homologous end joining nhej process re ligates the dsbs generating insertion deletion indel mutations and enabling existing genes to be edited deleted or new ones inserted unlike zfns and talens sgrna is the only component that needs designation for each genomic target thereby significantly simplifying the design and lowering the cost of gene editing compared to the protein based target recognition platforms to date crispr cas has been applied extensively in many species and promises to transform the fields of genome editing in plants and animals mstn knockout strains utilizing zygote microinjection of crispr cas have been produced recently for laboratory animals and livestock multiplex genome editing using cas endonuclease also can be applied easily by co delivering a combination of sgrnas to target multiple genomic loci simultaneously recently crispr mutagenesis was performed to edit various genes including mstn in some aquaculture species the channel catfish mstn gene has been cloned and characterized and has only one orthologous mstn gene in their genome like other mstn genes in mammals and teleost the i punctatus mstn gene consists of three exons and two introns and encodes a protein consisting of amino acids that span three conserved domains with two proteolytic sites in between dibasic rx and tetrabasic rxxr at amino acids and respectively fig a the roles of myostatin in channel catfish however still need further investigation in this study we used crispr zygote microinjection to knockout mstn gene in channel catfish and determined the effects of knockout on growth due to the long generation time of channel catfish we limited our study to early growth we aim to produce growth enhanced lines of channel catfish with crispr technology these gene edited lines would then be fully characterized for growth rate feed efficiency and disease resistance and compared to genotypes currently used in aquaculture figure design of the crispr cas system a schematic diagram of channel catfish mstn a signal sequence n terminal secretory signal a

treatment groups fig aa fin clips are the most desirable tissue to assay as they cause minimal damage to the fish and they regenerate if fin clips mirror the mutation type found in all tissues the

additionally the average total area of muscle fibers was increased in the mutant m as compared to the wild type channel catfish m t test t p the percentage of muscle fiber area was also higher in the mutants than in wild types t test t p fig g h altogether these findings indicate that mutated channel catfish showed hyperplasia as well as hypertrophy discussion the sgrna s and cas protein were directly co injected into one cell embryos and gene editing of the channel catfish mstn gene was successfully accomplished we utilized crisprscan to design the sgrnas and selected the sgrnas with the highest scores to target the i punctatus mstn gene as crisprscan was originally designed based upon the zebrafish danio rerio genome we assume that the phylogenetically close relationship between the genomes of channel catfish and zebrafish had an important impact on the successful targeting of these designed sgrnas in channel catfish all designed sgrnas worked effectively at their target sites on the mstn gene with high mutagenesis efficiencies the mutation rate in teleosts using crispr cas system varies fluctuating from to although the crispr cas system cas plasmid was previously microinjected in channel catfish in our laboratory with a mutation rate embryo hatch and early fry survival rates were only and respectively in the present study these rates were raised prominently to about for hatching and for early fry survival with high mutation rates table also the overall mutation rates were higher than those obtained in atlantic salmon salmo salar common carp cyprinus carpio and nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus to assess the effects of injection and crispr cas system on embryo survival hatch rate and early fry survival we included an injected control group as well as a normal control group using injection solution devoid of crispr cas system components we did not observe any abnormalities pre or post hatching the higher embryo mortality in injected groups compared to the nctrl group may be due to the microinjection procedures since all embryos were full siblings exposed to the same handling stress and reared using the same environmental conditions oligonucleotides are most active when injected directly into the embryo cell rather than the yolk however this injection procedure needs careful orientation of the embryos and is more time consuming we co microinjected cas protein and sgrna s directly into the yolk at the one cell stage so that it would be transferred to the cytoplasm through cytoplasmic streaming this approach proved adequate to edit the genome requiring less time and effort during microinjection with less disruption of embryos leading to high mutation and survival rates this approach could explain why the embryo hatch and early fry survival rates were high in this study compared to that of qin et al using microinjection of the blastodisc or electroporation also using cas protein instead of its plasmid eliminated the time required for expression of cas plasmid making genome targeting during the one cell stage about minutes in channel catfish of embryonic development more likely and with high mutation rate crispr cas was highly effective as a large percentage of the embryos were mutated within the target sites along the open reading frame and no mutations were detected nearby and outside the target site the genome was not examined for off target mutations most mutations should lead to a frame shift that results in a premature stop codon early termination in translation and disrupt the molecular functions of the protein fortunately about two thirds of the deletions and insertions were frame shift mutations which most likely caused gene truncations fig bf compared to wild type the patterns and lengths of amplicon bands revealed with gel electrophoresis differed depending on the treatment group of the mutated fry unsurprisingly the mutated samples of mstn mix group showed the most variable banding patterns as revealed by gel electrophoresis in the same manner the alignment of mstn mix group sequences revealed the most variable types of mutation another important finding was the large deletion in exon i of the mstn gene resulting from the injection of the three sgrnas in combination the mstn mix group crispr cas system could be used to achieve large genomic deletions not only in one gene but also in different chromosomal loci by delivering two pairs or more of sgrnas together with cas nuclease targeting different genomic sites simultaneously since applied genetics research focuses upon economically important traits hyper muscularity after targeting the mstn gene has been studied in many mammals the average body weights of mstn mutant mammals were higher than wild types regarding mstn mutated teleosts the growth rate enhancement of mstn mutants was to these results were with the small model species zebrafish which does not always translate into the same results in larger fishes in the present study we evaluated the phenotypic effects on muscle mass growth in the earliest weeks post hatching the mean body weight of mutated fry was increased by the mutant genotypes exhibited hyperplasia increase in fiber number and hypertrophy increase in fiber diameter of muscle fibers as compared to wild type and was the likely explanation of the growth differences between the mutants and wild types the number and size of muscle fibers are highly important factors in determining body size in teleosts this is the first time that cas protein has been directly delivered to edit genes in this biologically and commercially interesting teleost species channel catfish we anticipate that this technology will be the principal tool for further molecular and functional studies especially for channel catfish since its genome is now known our study goes beyond vertebrate models zebrafish and medaka and addresses the utility of the crispr cas as a tool for generating gene edited channel catfish and potentially other aquaculture species with high efficiency and accompanied with significant phenotypic change this technology is also especially relevant for teleosts with extended generation times years like channel catfish as the extensive mutation in virtually all individuals and especially in all tissues allows solid phenotypic evaluation in the founding generation of channel catfish without having to wait to generate subsequent generations further study is still needed to evaluate the carcass composition and meat quality traits of mutated individuals when they reach commercial food size g other physiological parameters and immune status should also be considered and linked to the productivity of these gene modified lines materials and methods design and preparation of sgrna and crispr cas systemusing the crisprscan online tool three small guide rnas were customized targeting the i punctatus mstn gene genbank accession no af the

greased spawning pan sexually mature kansas random channel catfish males were euthanized and the testes were crushed and macerated into saline nacl to release sperm and prepare a sperm solution fertilization microinjection and embryo incubationapproximately eggs were transferred to a greased spawning pan then ml of the normal sperm solution were added to the eggs and mixed gently fresh water was added to the eggs and gently swirled for seconds to activate the sperm and eggs more fresh water was added and the eggs were allowed to harden for min before microinjection the fertilized eggs were injected according to the procedures for zygote injection developed and modified recently in our laboratory briefly a mm od borosilicate glass capillary was pulled into two needles with a vertical needle puller a very thin layer of vegetable shortening was applied to a mm clean petri dish fifty to one hundred eggs were transferred from the fertilization pan to the petri dish in a single layer and covered with holtfreters solution mmol nacl mmol kcl mmol nahco mmol cacl mmol mgso using a microinjection system from applied scientific instrumentation eugene or nanoliters of the mixture were directly injected into the yolk of each fertilized egg one cell embryos were injected through minutes post fertilization and just before the beginning of the first cell division the injected control embryos were injected with the solution devoid of sgrna cas mixture the injected and control embryos were reared in l tubs filled with holtfreters solution containing ppm doxycycline and incubated with continuous aeration at c for days until hatching dead embryos were removed and the solution was changed daily channel catfish fry then were kept in l containers for one month mutation analysisgenomic dna extractionfin clip samples were collected from one month old fry on ice five fry from each treatment were euthanized and samples from barbel gills muscle intestine and eye were collected to study possible mosaicism of the mutations among different tissues the dna was extracted using the regular protocol proteinase k digestion followed by protein precipitation and iso propanol precipitation of dna quality and quantity of dna were checked with the nanodrop spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific polymerase chain reaction pcr and surveyor analysisthe primer sets for pcr were designed to cover all possible mutation sites fig b pcr was performed using the expand high fidelityplus pcr system roche the pcr amplification procedure was as follows initial denaturation for min at c followed by cycles of c for s c for s and c for s and a final elongation at c for min the resulting pcr product length was verified in a agarose gel the surveyor mutation detection kit for standard gel electrophoresis integrated dna technologies coralville ia was used to detect mutations pcr products were denatured and re annealed as follows c for min to c at c s to c at c s cooling to c and then nuclease s was mixed with enhancer s and mgcl and added to the pcr products above and incubated at c for hour the digested products were separated in a agarose gel and compared to those from a non edited channel catfish fig a cloning and sequencingto confirm and identify the mutations in each treatment genomic dna was obtained from five positive mutated individuals for each treatment and amplified with pcr and the resulting amplicons were cloned into the topo ta cloning kit for sequencing invitrogen carlsbad ca and then sent for sequencing to eurofins genomics louisville ky alignments of nucleotides and amino acid sequences were created and interpreted using t coffee tool histologyto clarify the effect of mstn knockout on skeletal muscle we performed histological analysis and statistical quantitative analyses of muscle fibers in skeletal muscle of mutant and wild type channel catfish four each of one month old fry from mutant individuals with frame shift mutation and control groups were euthanized with tricaine methane sulfonate ms western chemical inc ferndale wa subsequently catfish muscles were dissected cross sectioned and fixed in paraformaldehyde at room temperature for at least hours and then dehydrated and paraffin embedded using tissue tek ii sakura finetek usa inc ca serial sections were made at m thickness using a rotary microtome american optical corporation southbridge ma the sections were mounted on glass slides and stained with the regressive staining method using harris hematoxylin vwr international pa and eosin with phloxine sigma aldrich inc mo muscle fibers were counted cell numbers were calculated as the number of fibers per cross sectional muscle area using the cell counter features of imagej program and used for evaluating fiber size statistical analysisstatistical analysis of microinjected embryo survival hatching and early fry survival were performed with spss software ibm corporation armonk ny dead embryos were collected recorded and assigned a value representing the time of death days post fertilization dpf mortality was calculated as the number of dead embryos in each treatment divided by the total number of embryos in the same treatment and multiplied by survival curves for embryos and fry and the time to hatch for all treatment and control groups were compared using kaplan meier test pairwise comparisons of mean survival and hatch time were performed using log rank mantel cox test independent samples t tests were used to compare body weight and body length growth parameters between mutant all positive fish from treatment groups and non mutated all negative fish and controls depending on the surveyor analysis independent samples t tests also were performed to compare between mutants and wild types in terms of muscle fiber density fibers number and size the protocol for calculating the t value took into account whether variances were homogeneous the shapirowilk test was utilized for analysis of normality of the data the data that were not normally distributed were analyzed with the mannwhitney u test two tailed analyses were performed with sas version sas
